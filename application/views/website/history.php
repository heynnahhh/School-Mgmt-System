												It was called the Manila High School when it was opened in 1906 up 
												to 1921, when it got its new name, Manila South High School, which 
												it used until 1930, when it was finally given its present name in 
												honor of, by then, the late Chief Justice of the Philippines Manuel 
												Araullo. <br><br>

												Its brethren schools in the City of Manila—Arellano High, Torres 
												High and Abad Santos High—were all named after Supreme Court 
												justices. Arellano High is named to honor the first Chief Justice of 
												the Philippines, Cayetano Arellano. Before that, Arellano High was 
												called the Manila North High School throughout the American and 
												Commonwealth periods of our history. <br><br>

												Torres High is named for Associate Justice Florentino Torres. Abad 
												Santos High honors Chief Justice Abad Santos, who was not only a 
												model in upholding the rule of law, civil liberties and commitment 
												to dispense justice fairly but died for his commitment as a martyr. 
												He was executed by the Japanese invaders. <br><br>

												Although the Araullo, Arellano, Torres and Abad Santos high schools 
												also excel in their own ways these days, there is something lacking 
												about them now that somehow places them below the level of certain 
												iconic private schools, some specialized Science high schools and 
												the UP High School.<br><br>

												During the Commonwealth period and up to the 1950s, the public 
												schools under the Division of City Schools of the City of Manila 
												were the producers of some of the best minds to emerge into the 
												national consciousness as educators, writers, economists, diplomats, 
												lawyers and even presidents. In those days the graduates of these 
												schools—in the main—could all be relied on to pass on the basic 
												virtues and a sense of honor to their children. In the days before 
												World War II it was said that the graduates of these schools could 
												teach basic education—in good English—to their own children and to 
												formal pupils if they were hired to teach right away.<br><br>

												Those who are still around after the tutelage they got from their 
												Araullo, Arellano, Torres and Abad Santos teachers in the fifties 
												and earlier will swear how their English, Math, Biology, General 
												Science and Vocational Education teachers all contributed to their 
												skills and their knowledge, to their ability to comprehend and 
												absorb higher studies at colleges and universities.<br><br>

												Among the alumni were three former presidents, 
												Manuel A. Roxas, Jose P. Laurel and Elpidio Quirino; the inimitable 
												foreign secretary and first president of the United Nations General 
												Assembly Carlos P. Romulo; and the country's grand dame of 
												pediatricians, Dr. Fe del Mundo.<br><br>


												How much happier and fulfilled the present generation of Filipinos 
												would now be if Araullo High and its brethren, and the many 
												government high schools that were opened after the Second World War, 
												had maintained the standards of teaching and discipline that were 
												brought to this archipelago by the Thomasites.<br><br>
